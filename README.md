`ognoc` is a cryptosystem which offers you kinda ability to set strong password to protect your personal information.


## Why `ognoc`?

`ognoc` is a variation of Congo, they are anagram. I use it as the name of cryptosystem to create confusion, just like our password, while you can remember it, you can't guess its meaning. Of course, Ognoc more than that, it can do more, welcome to try it.
